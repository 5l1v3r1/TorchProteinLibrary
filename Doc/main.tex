\section{Introduction}
Protein folding is a problem of predicting the atomic structure of a protein given its amino-acid sequence. 
The challenging part of this problem is the complexity of the manifold to which belongs a protein structure.
The key idea of the library is the local conversion of this manifold to the euclidian space, where deep learning
techniques can be applied. After some machine learning algorithm provides prediction of the folding step in this 
local space, we have to convert this step back to the changes of the coordinates on the manifold.
