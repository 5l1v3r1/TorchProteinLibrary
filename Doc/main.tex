\section{Introduction}
Protein folding is a problem of predicting the atomic structure of a protein given its amino-acid sequence. 
The challenging part of this problem is the complexity of the manifold to which belongs a protein structure.
The key idea of the library is the local conversion of this manifold to the euclidian space, where deep learning
techniques can be applied. After some machine learning algorithm provides prediction of the folding step in this 
local space, we have to convert this step back to the changes of the coordinates on the manifold.

\subsection{From Euclidian space to Manifold}
I will derive the derivatives of angles using simple analogy to the rigid body kinematics.
When we compute the derivative of a single angle with respect to the coordinates of a single atom, 
we assume all other angles constant, which means that the protein behaves as a rigid body on a joint.

Much more simple approach would be the following:
