This needs access to cnpy: https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy

You can build that library and dump the cnpy.h and libcnpy.a files in
the root to make the Makefile work.

You will also need suitable input data files:

A.npy
dr_dangle.npy
gradInput.npy
gradInputRef.npy
gradOutput.npy
input_angles.npy

There are suitable data files packed in data.tar.xz.  This archive
will expand to 1.9Gb when uncompressed.
